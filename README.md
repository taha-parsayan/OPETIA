# OPETIA (Odense-Oxford PET Image Analysis)
OPETIA is a user-friendly PET/MRI (Positron EMission Tomography / Magnetic Resonance Imagine) image analysis toolbox, based on the FSL software (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library) and Python, for accurate brain image quantification. While FSL is widely used for MRI, OPETIA extends its functionality to PET imaging, offering a graphical interface to preprocess images and calculate SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) and SUVR (Standardized Uptake Value ratio) values.
