# OPETIA (Odense-Oxford PET Image Analysis)
OPETIA is a user-friendly PET/MRI (Positron EMission Tomography / Magnetic Resonance Imaging) image analysis toolbox, developed based on the FSL software (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library) and Python, for accurate brain image quantification. While FSL is widely used for MRI, OPETIA extends its functionality to PET imaging, offering a graphical interface to preprocess images and calculate SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) and SUVR (Standardized Uptake Value ratio) values. Image processing with OPETIA does not require the users to have previous knowledge of medical image processing or programming since all the parameter for both MRI and PET image pre-processings are already set as default. At the same time, these parameters are provided in the GUI so that the users can modify them if needed.
The inputs of OPETIA include MRI T1-weighted, static PET, and subject's information (body weight, height, total injected dose of the radiotracer).
The ourputs of OPETIA include
