Two versions of MRIcroGL are provided:

1.) "MRIcroGL" uses the GTK2 widgetset. This is recommended for Ubuntu 19.04 and earlier. For Ubuntu 19.10 or later you will need to install GTK2 to run this version (run "sudo apt-get install appmenu-gtk2-module" and then restart).

2.) "MRIcroGL_QT" uses the QT5 widgetset. This is recommended for Ubuntu 19.10 or later. 
 - On Ubuntu 19.10 or later you should run "sudo apt install libqt5pas1" to install the supporting libraries.
 - QT5 is not well supported on Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier.
 - The QT5 header library provided for Ubuntu 18.04 has issues. If you do want to use "MRIcroGL_QT" on Ubuntu 18.04 you will need to run the following commands:

wget -O- http://neuro.debian.net/lists/bionic.us-nh.libre | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neurodebian.sources.list
sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 0xA5D32F012649A5A9
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install libqt5pas1

If this does not work, try installing the .deb (if you are using a Deiban-based distribtuion like Ubuntu) or .rpm (if you are using a Red Hat distribution) file found here:

MRIcroGL requires a Graphics card and driver that supports OpenGL Core 3.3 or later. You can find out about your graphics card and driver with the following commands:

lspci | grep VGA
lsmod | grep "kms\|drm"
find /dev -group video
cat /proc/cmdline
find /etc/modprobe.d/
cat /etc/modprobe.d/*kms*
ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf
glxinfo | grep -i "vendor\|rendering"
grep LoadModule /var/log/Xorg.0.log

If "lspci | grep VGA" lists your graphics card as "NVidia" but "glxinfo | grep -i "vendor\|rendering"" lists your driver as Mesa or "nouveau" you should consider upgrading to the genuine NVidia graphics driver which will provide much better performance:
